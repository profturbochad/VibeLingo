## Implementation Plan: Vibelingo Base Game

**File:** `plan.md`  
**Goal:** Build a functional base version of "VibeLingo," a 3D multiplayer web game where student witches and wizards on broomsticks fly around a fantasy bay, collect pixies, and cast foreign words as spells. This plan covers the core mechanics: flight, pixie collection, basic combat, and multiplayer support using Three.js, Socket.IO, Node.js with Express, and SQLite.

### Overview
This plan breaks the development into small, testable steps.

* Step 1: Set Up Project Structure and Server

Test: Confirm the page loads without console errors (itâ€™ll be blank for now).

* Step 2: Initialize Three.js Scene and Add Ground Plane

Test: Verify a 3D blue ground plane appears.

* Step 3: Add Night Sky

Test: Verify the sky is dark

## Notes

- Every new edit to the codebase should be accompanied by an incremented version number which is output to the console log.
